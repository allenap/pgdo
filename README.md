<p style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem">⚠️ ALPHA QUALITY ⚠️</p>

This project is in the early stages of development. It is far from feature
complete. It likely contains many bugs and inconsistencies. Documentation is
limited or non-existent. It will change in ways that break backwards
compatibility. **It is not ready for production use**.

That said, if you want to try it out, please do! But bear in mind that it is
being updated frequently, at least at the time I'm writing this, and you should
expect to update it frequently too. **Please check out known issues and file
new ones [here](https://github.com/allenap/pgdo/issues)**.

Thanks! Gavin.
